# CMPSC F363 1 Intro to Database Systems - Fall 2025 Semester Project
## Nigel Karunaratne

This is a database project that implements a frontend and backend.

- The backend uses Java Spring Boot + MySQL
- The frontend uses Node.js + React, Bootstrap, Vite

## Running

To run the backend service locally, navigate to the folder `backend_spring` and run `./gradlew bootRun`.

To run the frontend service locally, navigate to `frontend-react` and run `npm run dev`. Make sure the packages are installed (react, react-router-dom, bootstrap, vite).
The frontend will typically be hosted on `localhost:5173`
